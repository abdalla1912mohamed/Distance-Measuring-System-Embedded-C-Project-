# Distance-Measuring-System-Embedded-C-Project-
- Developing a system on an ATMEGA32 microcontroller that measures the distance and displays it on LCD using the following driver modules : GPIO, ICU, LCD and Ultrasonic-Sensor .
- run The proteus code on a avr compiler and import the hexfile in the proteus simulation .
